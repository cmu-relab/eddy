# eddy

To complete the Eclipse project folder setup:

1. Create a subfolder named "lib/"
2. Download and unzip the OWL reasoner package(s) into the "lib/" folder
3. Update the Eclipse project Java build path to include the .jar distributions for the OWL reasoner

For v1.0, we successfully tested Eddy using two OWL reasoners, Fact++ v1.6.2 and HermiT v1.3.8
